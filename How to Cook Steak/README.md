2. Heating the Pan or Grill 

   - If using a cast iron skillet, heat it over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes until it's very hot. If using a grill, preheat it to high heat.

   - Once the pan or grill is hot, add a little oil to the skillet or brush it on the grill grates.


3. Cooking the Steak 

   - Place the steak in the hot pan or on the grill. You should hear a sizzle immediately.

   - Sear the steak for about 2-3 minutes on each side for a medium-rare steak. Do not move the steak around; let it develop a nice crust.

   - Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature.

       > Rare: 125 Degrees F 
       > Medium-Rare: 135 Degrees F
       > Medium: 145 Degrees F
       > Medium-Well: 150 Degrees F
       > Well-Done: 160 Degrees F 

4. Basting (Optional)

   - If you want extra flavor, add a tablespoon of butter, a smashed garlic clove, and a sprig of herbs to the pan.

   - Tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to continuously baste the steak with the melted butter and juices for the last minute of cooking.

5. Resting the Steak

   -  Once the steak reaches your desired doneness, remove it from the pan or grill.

   -  Place the steak on a cutting board and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the steak juicier.
